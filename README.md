# EchoGuard

Leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones, this project introduces an "Emergency Reporting System Powered by Voice Recognition and Blockchain Technology." Designed for immediate, hands-free activation via voice commands during crises, it aims to swiftly locate and summon aid, minimizing the impact of accidents. Focused on enhancing campus safety, the system integrates Google's voice recognition on smartphones to facilitate report initiation without the need for dialing. Users simply voice out keywords, prompting the system to record the incident details and track their location via GPS and internet positioning. This data is then securely transmitted to the response center using blockchain technology, optimizing rescue operations.

Additionally, this system's utility extends to disaster prevention and reporting infractions, enabling users to report incidents hands-free, such as vehicle accidents on highways, thereby promoting safety without compromising the user's current activity.
